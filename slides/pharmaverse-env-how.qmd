## Agenda

-   Some beautiful code
-   Closer look at a function
-   Main points

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```


## Closer look at code from function

This code is coming from a function in a package:

```{r filename="foo.R"}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1-3|5" 

foo <- \(x) {
  print(x)
}

foo("Hello")
```
